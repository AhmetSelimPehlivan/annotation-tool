  ###
  - First things first, in order to use Firebase, you need to log in to your Firebase console and create a new project
  - You then need to install the Firebase CLI tools:
  ```shell
   npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```
  - Next, we will setup a firebase context for the current application. For that, in the same root folder, type:
  ```shell
   firebase init
  ```
  - One final step before deploying your application: you just need to make sure that you are logged in to your Firebase account:
  ```shell
   firebase login
  ```
  - Finally, it is time to deploy our application to millions of users:
  ```shell
   firebase deploy
  ```
  - Great job! You can now visit the generated URL and experience your live application. If you prefer to use a custom URL, you have the option to modify it using Firebase hosting.
